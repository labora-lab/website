## Our Mission

LABORA's mission is to develop cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence, biomodeling, and data analysis applied to public health, contributing to the prevention and control of infectious diseases and epidemic outbreaks.

## Research Areas

### Artificial Intelligence Applied to Public Health

We develop machine learning and deep learning models for outbreak prediction, assisted diagnosis, and analysis of epidemiological patterns.

### Mathematical Modeling of Infectious Diseases

We use compartmental and agent-based mathematical models to simulate the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and evaluate intervention strategies.

### Epidemiological Data Analysis

We perform statistical and computational analyses of large epidemiological databases to identify trends, patterns, and risk factors.

### Health Surveillance Systems

We develop tools and systems for real-time monitoring of health indicators and early detection of outbreaks.

## Affiliation

LABORA is affiliated with the **School of Applied Mathematics (EMAp)** at **Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV)**.
